# geo-advanced-research

Real-time documentation of my deep dive into advanced GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). 

---

If you are new here, have a read of my [NLP notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/nlp-principles-model-behavior-geo.md) before diving in here. This repository documents my learning post NLP basics, filling blindspots and knowing the foundation of GEO.

## Tentative Structure

### Week 1: Multi-modal, citations, token economics
- Multi-modal search 
- Security & prompt injection 
- Citations 
- Token economics 
- API vs consumer models 
- Semantic search architecture 
- AI agents & multi-step reasoning 

### Week 2: Build Phase
- Tracking what actually matters 
- Personalization layers (how AI remembers users)
- Enterprise RAG systems

I will update the rest of the outline as I make progress on this learning path.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Daily Research Notes**: My actual rough notes, comments and next steps
- **Frameworks**: If I can document a mental model that can be referenced later, I will do that here.

## Current Status
